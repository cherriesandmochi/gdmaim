# How to contribute?
GDMaim, improvements by the community.

## Reporting a issue
Use the issues tab to report any problems if something isn't working with your scripts.

>[!tip]
>Remember, the first step before making a **report issue** is to check if the problem does not come from something external to the plugin scope.

For a quick fix, please include these details.

* Image with errors and/or description of the issue with console message errors. (Required)
* Godot version. (Required)
* gdmaim last updated version. (Required, use the master branch to avoid confusion)

For the next details, we recommend that you first your check and identify where the problem raise in you project. It would help us resolve it if we could only see its origin without having to analyze you entire project.

* Part of the code or the entire file that you believe is causing the problem. (optional)
* Generated sourcemap. (optional)

## GDBC Library Troubleshooting
The library was normally updated for Godot 4.5, but if you have problems with future versions or the library for your operating system is not available, you will need to compile it yourself from the following link.

 [GDBC Repository Link](https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/gdbc)

If you encounter a problem compiling in a recent version of Godot, perhaps due to a change in the internal API, you can report the problem and we'll see if we can help you with that situation.
